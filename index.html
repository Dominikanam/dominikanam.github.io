				<h1>Katy Perry - Cozy Little Christmas<h1>
					<p>
							Everybody’s in a hurry, in a flurry
							Shopping till their dropping in the snow
							Kids are crying, dogs are barking
							Catching up with folks we barely know
					</p>
					<p>		Sure it’s madness, but it’s magic
							As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
							Cause you’re the reason for the season
							No, we don’t need to keep up with the Jones

							Our love is something priceless
					</p>
					<p>
							I don’t need diamonds, no sparkly thangs (no oh oh oh oh)
							Cause you can’t buy this-a-feeling (no oh oh oh oh)
							Nothing lights my fire, or wraps me up, baby, like you do
							Just want a cozy, a cozy little Christmas here with you

							So Mr. Santa (Mr. Santa)
							Take the day off (Take the day off)
							Get a massage (Get a massage)
							Cause we got this one all under control
							A little whiskey (A little whiskey)
							We’re getting frisky (Ohh!)
							N slow dancing to Nat King Cole
					</p>
