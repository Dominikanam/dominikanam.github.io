				<h1>Katy Perry - Cozy Little Christmas<h1>
					<p>
							Everybody’s in a hurry, in a flurry
							Shopping till their dropping in the snow
							Kids are crying, dogs are barking
							Catching up with folks we barely know
					</p>
					<p>		Sure it’s madness, but it’s magic
							As soon as you hang up the mistletoe
							Cause you’re the reason for the season
							No, we don’t need to keep up with the Jones

							Our love is something priceless
					</p>
